# Portfolio Project

#### Description
This website is a place to exhibit my individual abilities, present an outline of the projects in my portfolio, and offer insight into my background and expertise. Its created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the widely-used frameworks of Bootstrap and Google Fonts for design and styling.

#### How To Run
Fork and clone the repository. Open the "index.html" file in your local browser.

#### Roadmap To Future Improvements
I will continue to add to my portfolio as new projects are completed. I plan to integrate more Bootstrap for color and design.
